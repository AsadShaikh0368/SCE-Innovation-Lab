# DONUTS AND DATA
## _SCE - Innovation and Excellence Labs_

### Pre-requisites

if you are using VS code on Debian / Ubuntu or vs code on WSL on windows, the following instructions would help you setup the environment faster
```
cd {project-root}
bash set_local_env.bash
```

if you are not using either wsl on windows or ubuntu, get inspired and follow the script manually to install the requirements found in following files, in your respective OS / environment:
* [vs code requirements](requirements/vscode_requirements.txt)
* [pip python3 requirements](requirements/pip_requirements.txt)

### Instructions
<em>
NOTE: For all of these questions, you are free to use any and all resources available to you including but not limited to (<strong>stackoverflow</strong>, <strong>google</strong>, <strong>python coding blogs</strong>, even <strong>ChatGTP-4</strong> if you have to). 

Provide links to all the blogs / post / stackoverflow you went through to come up with this solution in each questions' <strong>*_reference_links.txt</strong> notepads. If you used ChatGPT, please provide with question you posed to the LLM!

Please fork out of this "main" branch into your project space. Publish back to "main" is prohibited!

When you have completed the assignment, respond with the link to your forked project or synced branch with your your contact information to reach out to including __email__, __phone__, __linkedIn url__
</em>
