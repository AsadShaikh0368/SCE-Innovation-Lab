    "<em>An auto company assembly line comprises of main line and sub line. The current Auto getting built as it moves in main or sub line comprises of many parts that are part of the assembly BOM (bill of material) for that auto. This BOM contains list of all the Parts that needs to be inputted to make up the Auto. As the car is getting assembled, the MES system keeps track (in real-time) of the Parts that are already Installed from the BOM. These installations happen on various Station within assembly line that perform various operations.  One station may or may not support multiple installation operations.............”\n",

    "On Dec 19th 2018, California Public utilities commission (__CPUC__) instituted Public Safety Power Shutoff (__PSPS__) order that allows utility companies to de-energize power lines in high risk / dangerous conditions that threatens life or property in California, with established PSPS guidelines for utility company to follow, which can be summarized as following user story:\n",
